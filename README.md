A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/sarizvi602/pen/Xprgqp.

 This app utilizes twitch tv API to display status and link of TwitchTV Channels. It has three tabs: first one displays all channels, second one displays only online channels, and last one displays offline channels or even channels that do not exist. This is done as a part of FreeCodeCamp coursework.
